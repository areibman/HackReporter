# HackReporter Improvements Summary

## 1. Video Processing Performance Optimization

### Issue
The video processing was potentially slow and not utilizing CrewAI's built-in parallel processing capabilities efficiently.

### Solution
- Replaced custom parallel processing implementation with CrewAI's native `kickoff_for_each_async()` method
- This ensures proper parallel execution as designed by the CrewAI framework
- Maintained the `SEQUENTIAL_MODE` option for cases where API quotas are a concern
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Code Changes
- Modified `crew.py` lines 187-223 to use `kickoff_for_each_async()` instead of custom asyncio implementation
- Simplified the parallel processing logic while maintaining the same functionality

## 2. Project Gallery Web Scraping

### Issue
Need to scrape hackathon project galleries (like Devpost) to find team member information and social media profiles.

### Solution
- Added `--url` parameter to CLI for specifying project gallery URLs
- Integrated Stagehand tool (already imported but unused) for web scraping
- Updated `team_research_task` to intelligently scrape project pages

### Implementation Details
1. **CLI Enhancement** (`test_cli.py`):
   - Added `--url` argument to accept project gallery URLs
   - Passes URL to `process_videos()` function

2. **Data Flow** (`crew.py`):
   - Updated `process_videos()` to accept `project_gallery_url` parameter
   - Includes URL in video inputs for each processing task

3. **Task Configuration** (`tasks.yaml`):
   - Enhanced `team_research_task` to:
     - Use Stagehand tool to navigate to project gallery
     - Find matching project based on video analysis
     - Extract team member names and profiles
     - Look for Twitter handles on project pages
     - Check personal websites for social media links

4. **Crew Configuration**:
   - Re-enabled `person_finder` agent and `team_research_task`
   - These were previously commented out but are now active

### Usage Example
```bash
python test_cli.py /path/to/videos --url https://devpost.com/project-gallery
```

## Performance Notes
- The native CrewAI parallel processing should be more efficient than the custom implementation
- Set `SEQUENTIAL_VIDEO_PROCESSING=true` environment variable if hitting API rate limits
- The Stagehand tool integration allows for intelligent web scraping without hardcoding URLs

## Next Steps
- Test the parallel processing improvements with multiple videos
- Verify Stagehand tool properly scrapes Devpost and similar platforms
- Consider adding caching for scraped project information to avoid redundant requests
